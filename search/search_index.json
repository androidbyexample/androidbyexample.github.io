Definitions \"Collective Work\" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License. \"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. \"Licensor\" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License. \"Original Author\" means the individual or entity who created the Work. \"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation. \"License Elements\" means the following high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, ShareAlike. 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws. 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works; to create and reproduce Derivative Works; to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works; to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works. For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition: Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights society or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work (\"cover version\") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions). Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions). The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved. 4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Japan). You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other license specified in the previous sentence with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit. 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7. Termination This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8. Miscellaneous Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.

Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8. Miscellaneous Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

I know it's not the most thrilling read, but please be sure to read it thoroughly. Course Content All course content (https://androidbyexample.com) and the course sample repository (https://gitlab.com/android-development-2022-refresh/605.686-2022-fall-term) are free for use to anyone. Feel free to pass these links to friends and co-workers. For those viewing the content who are not enrolled in 605.686, please ignore any references to the Canvas site, assignments or syllabus. Your Actions Please do the following Check that your email and phone numbers are correct in JHED and SIS. I'll use these to send announcements. If you saw this announcement in your email you should be ok. Please post in the \u201cIntroductions\u201d forum as described in the thread header. Note that there is only one thread; you cannot create separate threads for your introduction. Welcome! Hi there! I'm Scott Stanchfield. Welcome to 605.686, Mobile Application Development for the Android Platform! Let me give you an overview of what we will be doing this semester and where you should begin. We'll be exploring Android application development, covering all sorts of topics including creation of user interfaces, storing data, and communicating with other devices and servers. You can see the full list of topics on this course site. Be sure to pay close attention to the Course Outline. It'll tell you which modules are covered each week as well as start and due dates for the assignments. Please be sure to read this entire note, the syllabus (on the Canvas site), and all sections in the Introduction module. There are lots of very important things in there that I will hold you accountable for. In particular, please pay attention to the academic integrity (I'm good at catching cheaters!) and \"Holistic\" grading (so you understand what your grades actually mean) sections. The syllabus is available via the \"Syllabus\" link on the left menu in Canvas. Note that we've migrated to a common syllabus management tool to ensure all the common university-level information is consistent and up-to-date across all courses. There's an Export button when viewing the Syllabus if you'd like to download and print it. The Introduction module goes into more detail on assignment expectations and grading. Content Note This applies to online sections of the course. If you are taking the class face-to-face/virtual-live, you are responsible for material covered in class (which will be recorded and posted), and the https://androidbyexample.com site is provided only as additional information. I'm posting the course content that would normally appear in Canvas on https://androidbyexample.com. This allows a more custom experience. I'm trying out a new format that's less video-intensive, and hopefully will make it easier to locate information that you need. (Canvas currently doesn't allow custom CSS or Javascript and cannot support the features I'm trying to implement.) I'm not updating all of the material to this new format this term. When studying the content, text or video, please let me know which format works best for you. Sample Code Note This applies to online sections of the course. If you are taking the class face-to-face/virtual-live, you are responsible for material covered in class (which will be recorded and posted), and the course samples site is only provided as supplemental material. All sample code is available at https://gitlab.com/android-development-2022-refresh/605.686-2022-fall-term. Please install git and clone this repository. As I am currently updating the course, you'll need to pull changes when I announce that new content is available. If you haven\u2019t used git before... Download and install git from https://git-scm.com/ Create a directory to hold your git repositories. (I use c:\\users\\scott\\git on my windows machine, but you can put it anywhere you would like) Open a command prompt/terminal and change to that directory Run git clone https://gitlab.com/android-development-2022-refresh/605.686-2022-fall-term. (This will create a 605.686-2022-fall-term directory inside your git directory) Whenever I tell you to update the repository Open a command prompt/terminal and change to that android-development directory Run git pull Kotlin Note All assignments must be written in Kotlin. The text and videos in the course will talk through development environment setup and implementation using Kotlin and describe some of the concepts behind Kotlin along the way. I also teach a course in Kotlin (605.603) but it is not required for this course. It will, however, go into much more detail on the Kotlin language and I recommend everyone take it. Because, ya know, Kotlin is cool. Very, very cool Online Video Tips Some modules will link to video content. All videos are hosted on YouTube, and I\u2019ve enabled automatic closed captions/transcript. The transcript is useful for searching. To search videos: Click the \"...\" button under the video Choose \"Open Transcript\" Pause the video Press control-f (or whatever your browser\u2019s \"find\" command is) Type what you want to find Click on the transcript line you want to jump to and the video will jump there. Press play Note that the automatic transcripts are not perfect, but they can help you find what you\u2019re looking for (Eventually I\u2019ll be hand-editing them to improve accuracy). All videos were recorded and rendered at 1920x1080 (HD). That's the ideal size to watch them (if you\u2019re watching full screen. If you're watching non full-screen, with the transcript, you'll want to have your resolution set higher to reduce artifacts. Make sure the settings for the video playback are HD/1080p for the best image. I\u2019ve increased the font size in Android Studio when recording, but you\u2019ll want to be sure things are as clear as possible. Keep in mind that YouTube allows you to change the playback speed. Some students like to speed up or (more likely, as I talk quickly at times) slow down a bit. Office Hours Office Hours will be held each Monday from 7pm-8pm Eastern. Please use the \"Office Hours\" link from the Canvas site to enter the Zoom office hours session. Note that if no one shows up by 7:20p, I\u2019ll close the session (unless you have let me know in advance that you intend to come and will be late) Questions If you have questions during the course, please: Search using Google or StackOverflow for ideas. You can often find a response faster than I will see your question and respond. Check the forum and see if the question has been asked If the question isn't private (such as a question about your grades), please post it in the discussion forums If it's a private matter, please email me at scott.stanchfield@jhu.edu Please use the forums as much as possible for questions; many students often have the same questions and this makes it easy for everyone to learn. As you progress through the course, if you have comments about the content (things you really like, dislike, or how things can be done better ), please post in the Course Feedback forum or keep a log of your thoughts to send to me after the course is finished. (For those who are not enrolled in the course, please email me at scott@javadude.com with any comments or siggesti) If you have any questions or concerns while going through this course you may post them in the General Questions thread, located under Discussions on the left menu in Canvas or you may contact me directly at scott.stanchfield@jhu.edu.

Coding Conventions All assignments must observe the following coding conventions. Why? I read your code Sometimes your code doesn't work correctly (sometimes spectacularly so...). Before I decide on the grade to give you, I carefully read the code to try to figure out why it didn't work. If the reason is a small, subtle thing, I'll often give more credit (rather than simply saying \"doesn't work; you get a C\") I often have to do this for several assignments. If the code is readable, using meaning variable, method and class names, I can often find the problems more quickly. Keep in mind that I have many submissions to review each time, and usually 20% or more have some big issues. This also helps a good bit when some of you are having trouble before submitting and ask for help. If I can read the code, I can figure out what's going on and respond that much more quickly.

My grader and I assign letter grades first, then convert them to numbers and apply late penalties. The grading scale from letters to numbers is as follows: Letter Grade Numerical Equivalent A 4.0 A- 3.7 (A/B border) 3.5 B+ 3.3 B 3.0 B- 2.7 (B/C border) 2.5 C+ 2.3 C 2.0 C- 1.7 (C/D border) 1.5 D+ 1.3 D 1.0 D- 0.7 F 0 Note that there is no A+. We had been reserving that for \"exemplary\" submissions, but some students considered an \"A\" as lost points. Your final grade WILL NOT include +/- designations. A/A- both count as \"A\" and \"4\" for University GPA purposes(and similar for other letter grades). Late Penalty Each day late results in 1 full letter grade (1 point) off. This is to prevent cascading lateness. In the past students would submit an assignment a week late and have one week less to do the next assignment, which would often result in that assignment being late as well. The also made it difficult to discus assignments until all were submitted. When grading assignments, we will write comments describing your grade, but we will usually not note specific point-value deductions (see \"Holistic Grading\" below). Some comments are \"for your information\"/\"helpful hints\" and will be marked to indicate that they have no effect on the grade. If you disagree with a grade you can ask us to review it. Tell us what your concerns are and we'll look at it. Sometimes we may miss something in your code. If we note a problem with a submission that was also noted for a previous submission, we will not count off for it. (If we do, please let use know and we'll correct the grade.) \"Holistic\" Grading I started out using a rubric to grade. For many reasons, this almost never reflected reality, so after a few terms, I realized a much fairer scheme, that I call \"holistic grading\" First, some problems with Rubrics... Gaming the System When I had point counts next to features, many students would decide which features to implement based on how many points they felt they could afford to lose. Rather than implement all function (the point of which is to exercise important techniques), they would implement a subset just to \"get the grade\". This is frustrating for a teacher because we design exercises to be sure students have had the opportunity to try out important techniques. \"Sum of the Parts\" vs \"The Whole\" Rubrics tend to cut both ways when the points are added up... Sometimes, a few relatively minor things that don't greatly impact the overall submission would numerically push the grade into \"B\" territory or lower. This didn't feel fair to the student based on the overall result, but to be fair to all students I had to stick with the grade based off the rubric. Other times, small things that made an impact when combined could result in an \"A\" that didn't feel right (sometimes because of gaming the system, other times because the small problems really added up). \"That shouldn't be n points off\" The most common complaint would be that either the rubric was unfair in the number of points it assigned to a specific item, or that I was applying a rubric item too broadly to a problem in the submission. Most of the time I would leave the grade as-is, but in some cases it was a matter of a possible alternative interpretation of the assignment requirements, in which case I adjusted the points off. Later, after I stopped using rubrics, but would list points deductions on assignment comments, I'd get the same complaints. In either case, this never made any significant difference in the grade for the assignment, or the course. Students ended up spending a good bit of time trying to figure out which items they could argue to get a few points back, not realizing a few points over the term made no effective difference. This led me to... \"Holistic Grading\" (If it sounds a little \"New Age\", it's not... \"Holistic\" here simply means \"looking at the whole\") \"This feels like a B+\"... My grader and I write comments about what we see in the assignment, and don't write specific deductions for each one. We look at the overall result, taking all comments into account, and say \"that's an A\", or \"that's a B-\", or \"that's barely anything more than the sample code\" (at which point we estimate the % of the assignment that was done and assign that number). The letters we assign are converted to numbers. A=4.0, A-=3.7, etc. When coming up with these letters, one of my key concepts is \"things that cap the grade at A-\". There's not a fixed list of such items, but things like \"coding conventions\" fall into this category. If several small things like these happen, a rubric may have pushed the grade into \"B\" territory. When I see several little things but otherwise the overall submission feels like an \"A\", I use \"A-\" as the grade. Note that if there are \"cap\" items as well as bigger issues, the \"cap\" items won't push the grade lower than the bigger issues already would have. Usually, if features are missing or not implemented per the assignment description, I start thinking \"B\", but if they're very minor features or present but not quite what was explicitly stated in the assignment description, and otherwise the assignment looked good, I'll go with \"A-\". Because of this, \"A-\" is often the most common grade for an assignment. If the assignment does everything we ask, in the ways I taught in class, meets coding standards, and is on time, that's where \"A\" comes in. Other grades (before late deductions) are usually driven by Feature omissions or problems Most common: something is missing or doesn't work properly This is often because a student started work a few days before the assignment was due and didn't have time to ask questions or study the concepts. Crashes and compilation errors Note that we try to make your code work before grading it. Sometimes it's an inverted boolean expression, and if we can get it working and it's something simple, we'll give a better grade than \"doesn't work\". However, sometimes, after spending an hour or two trying to get it to work, we have to give up... Working together or Plagiarism I've caught many students doing this... Sometimes they even try to submit something they found online that doesn't match the assignment description or is very obviously not based on what I've taught. Bottom line: When you see a \"3.7\" for a submission, don't think of it as \"0.3 points off\". Think of it as a few minor things aren't right. If that's how most of your assignments go, that's an \"A\" for the course... Distribution of Grades It is possible (and has happened in past sections) for everyone to get an \"A\" in this course. I will not be applying any sort of curve or other means to artificially distribute grades. I will be looking closely at your efforts in this class when determining your final grades. An \"A\" grade in this course requires a good deal of effort. Do not expect an \"A\" if you start programming a few nights before they are due... Let me repeat that. Do not expect an \"A\" if you start programming assignments a few nights before they are due... This has often been the reason for B and C grades in the course; students do not allow enough time to ask clarifying questions or do the coding. Be sure to at least look over and understand the assignments at the beginning of the week they are assigned! This will give you time to ask questions. If you do all the work well and on-time, you will get an \"A\" for the course. If you do all of the work on-time but are having trouble with the concepts, you'll likely get a \"B\" for the course.

We won't be using Views (other than Google Map) for this class, but you should be familiar with them. Objectives Understand how the Android system manages the lifecycle of an Activity, and some of the callbacks you can implement to become aware of changes in Activity state Shudder when you see the XML that you used to have to write for user interfaces.
